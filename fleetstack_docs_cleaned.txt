Create Cloud Server - Fleet Stack Guide
Build a secure, scalable, and robust cloud server on AWS. This step-by-step guide ensures you configure your instance like a pro.
: Fleet Stack Software offers you the flexibility to host it on any cloud platform you prefer. This allows you to tailor the deployment to your specific needs, ensuring optimal scalability, performance, and control over your cloud environment.
Setting up your server involves:
Accessing AWS EC2
to manage compute resources.
Launching and configuring an instance
tailored to your needs.
Setting up security
for safe and authorized access.
Connecting to your instance
remotely.
: 10â15 minutes
An active AWS account.
A stable internet connection.
Remote Desktop Client
(for Windows instances).
Basic knowledge of AWS terms like EC2, key pairs, and security groups.
Step 1: Log in to AWS
To create a cloud server, you'll first need to access AWS, the platform where the servers are hosted. This step involves logging into your account to use the tools available.
Navigate to the
AWS Management Console
Enter your credentials and sign in to access the AWS dashboard.
Pro Tip
: Use the AWS Console mobile app for on-the-go management.
Step 2: Open the EC2 Dashboard
AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is the service where your virtual servers are created and managed. You'll need to navigate to this section to start building your server.
From the top menu, click
Services
Under
Compute
, select
EC2
Instances
section to manage existing or create new instances.
Step 3: Launch a New Instance
An instance is your virtual server. Launching one means you're creating a computer in the cloud, specifying its size and operating system, just like setting up a new PC.
Configuration Steps:
Launch Instance
Fill in the following details:
Name
: Choose a recognizable name (e.g.,
MyAppServer
).
OS
: Select Windows Server operating system:
Windows Server
(default for Remote Desktop).
Instance Type
Start with
t2.medium
to proceed to storage setup.
Step 4: Configure Storage
Storage is the space your server uses to store data, much like the hard drive of your computer. In this step, you decide how much space your server needs.
Specify the required disk size:
General Purpose (SSD)
: 60 GB is typical for small projects.
For database-heavy workloads, consider
Provisioned IOPS SSD
Add additional volumes if required, such as:
A
data volume
for file storage.
backup volume
for critical data.
Step 5: Set Up Key Pair
A key pair is like a lock and key for accessing your server. The server has a lock, and you keep the key (a
.pem
file) on your computer for secure access.
Select or create a key pair to secure your instance:
Existing Key Pair
: Choose from the dropdown if available.
New Key Pair
Create Key Pair
Select
format for most platforms.
Download and store the
file securely.
Important
: Losing the
file means you cannot access your instance.
Step 6: Configure Security Groups
A security group is like a firewall for your server. It controls who can access your server and which activities are allowed. You'll configure rules here to ensure secure communication.
Go to the
Security Groups
section under EC2.
Create Security Group
and configure rules:
Protocol
Port Range
Source
Purpose
RDP
3389
0.0.0.0
Remote Desktop Access
HTTP
80
0.0.0.0/0
Enable access to web server
HTTPS
443
Secure web traffic
Microsoft SQL Server
1433
Server for database engine
Custom TCP
5000-6000
Custom Port Range
Best Practice
: Restrict access to your public IP (e.g.,
203.0.113.25/32
) instead of
for security.
Step 7: Review and Launch Your Instance
Before launching, youâll review all settings to ensure everything is configured correctly. After that, AWS will create your server and make it ready to use.
Double-check all configurations, including:
Instance type
Storage allocation
Security groups
Key pair
Wait for the instance to initialize.
Step 8: Allocate and Associate Elastic IP
An Elastic IP is a permanent address for your server. Assigning one ensures your serverâs address stays the same, even if it restarts.
Elastic IPs
under the EC2 menu.
Allocate Elastic IP Address
Associate the allocated IP to your instance:
Select the instance from the dropdown menu.
Save your settings.
ð
Why Elastic IP?
: It provides a static IP address that persists even if the instance is stopped or restarted.
Step 9: Connect to Your Instance
Once your server is running, you can access it remotely, just like logging into another computer. Youâll use tools like Remote Desktop to do this.
Return to the
tab and copy the
Public IP Address
Remote Desktop Connection
Paste the IP Address.
Enter the username (
Administrator
by default).
Use the private key to decrypt the password in the
RDP Client
Connect
to access your server.
ð ï¸ Troubleshooting & Best Practices
Common Issues and Solutions
Problem
Solution
Cannot connect to instance
Check that port 3389 (RDP) is open in the security group.
Lost
file
Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager if enabled or recreate your instance.
Instance not starting
Verify if your instance quota or region availability is sufficient.
ð Pro Tips for a Seamless Experience
Backups
: Regularly create snapshots of your instance volumes for disaster recovery.
Monitoring
: Enable
CloudWatch
to monitor instance performance and set alerts for CPU or memory usage spikes.
: Use
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
to enforce least privilege policies.
